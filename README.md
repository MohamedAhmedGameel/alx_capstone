# Book Store App

A simple and modern book store app built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Redux Toolkit**. The app fetches books from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/), featuring search functionality, category filters by subject, and displays the book's publication year as a substitute for pricing. Additionally, the hero section of the site is styled with a random image from **Unsplash**.

## Features

- **Search functionality**: Search for books by title, author, or subject.
- **Filters**: Filter books by subject (e.g., Science, Health, Business).
- **Book Display**: Display books with their titles, authors, first publication year, and covers (if available).
- **No Price**: Since the Open Library API does not provide pricing data, the app uses the **first published year** as a substitute for price.
- **Hero Section**: Uses a random image from Unsplash as a background for the hero section.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Redux Toolkit**: A state management library for managing global state.
- **Open Library API**: A free API that provides book data.
- **Unsplash API**: Used for fetching random background images for the hero section.
